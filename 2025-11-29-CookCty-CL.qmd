Dear Mr. Hicks:  

I am pleased to submit my application for Data Analyst III (Data Management Supervisor, #25-02021) to lead the Records and Information Management team within the IT Services Branch at Land Development Services. My extensive experience in leading complex data projects aligns with the job's requirements. My skills in strategic leadership, data management, documentation, team coaching, and stakeholder collaboration are highly relevant, and I have deep experience in driving innovative strategies to elevate and transform operations.

I possess a proven ability to lead projects, manage multiple priorities and stakeholders, and guide a talented team toward delivering exceptional results. I have shown I can lead in a public sector context, thanks to a decade of leadership roles in the Houston Independent School District. I have extensive experience defining and executing agency-wide data management strategies, including developing and enforcing robust data sharing/privacy agreements and protocols. Crucially, I excel at partnering with internal stakeholders and partner agencies to develop essential data management documentation, including process flowcharts and workflow diagrams. This task was a  critical component of my recent successful overhaul of the District's Finance Manual — a 'source of truth' document used by front-line clerks, in-house accountants, and external auditors alike. The Manual is the most recent of many projects where I identified opportunities for improvement and re-engineered business processes to stretch our efficiency. 

On the people side of data work, I am an experienced leader with six years of guiding, coaching, and mentoring technical analysts and customer-facing program staff. As a manager, I set high expectations and clear parameters, establish collaborative practices and operational protocols, and then both oversee and coach up where needed so our stakeholders see consistent, reliable results. I deliberately foster a high-performing, innovative, and mutually accountable team culture. My most recent experience leading the Data Science team to build, test, and ship complex data products with competing deadlines to stakeholders across the org chart prepared me well to thrive in a matrixed or "cross-functional" environment such as the LDS context described in the position description. I am prepared to guide the work of others and respond to others' needs with minimal oversight — as I did when providing strategic leadership and project management for senior leaders over $2.1 billion in annual operations.

<!-- * __Organization-wide Structures, Governance, and Committees.__  -->

I am ready to take charge, innovate, and elevate the data management functions at LDS, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my professional skills, public sector content knowledge, and personal values can contribute to the next chapter of LDS in Fairfax County. Thank you for your time and consideration.
